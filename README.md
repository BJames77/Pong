# Pong
If it doesn't run, VM options might be off.

For Intellij Idea: VM Options under Run Configurations:
--module-path %location\to\java\fx\library\here --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml


Known Issue:

(FIXED)Both paddles can't move at the same time


Additions to make:

Add randomization to the ball's starting speed

Add three different parts to the paddles to allow for adjustment to the angle of the ball

Make the ball's X and Y directions linked using trigonometry if necessary
